Put your final project proposal here.

For my final project in CS126, I wish to implement an interactive game called jungle mania which utilizes cinder for
game simulation. I plan to make an interactive game where a player traverses a level by jumping on blocks hanging mid
air, something on the lines of super-mario and lavaboy and watergirl

Week1
For week 1, I plan to implement a basic protoype of the game with just one level where the player object moves to the
exit door of the level to finish the game

Week2
For week 2, I plan to add powerups and levels with increasing difficulty to the game such that a player advances to a
higher level by completing lower levels. On the way, a player picks up power ups to help them during the game

Week 3 
For week 3, I plan to add randomly moving objects (which reduce xp, decreasing the player's energy) to create
obstacles in the game. I also plan to add other player features such as energy and other features as part of the 3rd
week.
